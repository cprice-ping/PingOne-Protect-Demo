# Bot Detection Scripts

One of the purposes of this demo is to show that PingOne Protect can detect non-human interactions with a web application.

This folder contains scripts that can be executed to show automated interaction through a browser.

Automation can be performed in several ways:

[chrome-recorder](./chrome-recorder/):

These files can be imported into Google Chrome and run using the built-in Developer Tools --> Recorder

[python](./python/):

Python scripts that leverage Selenium
